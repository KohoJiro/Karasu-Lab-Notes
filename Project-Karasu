# 🐦 Project Karasu: Lab Notes
## Day 0: Migration & Infrastructure Prep

**Date:** 2026-01-08  
**Status:** ✅ Phase 1 Complete

---

### 🛠 Actions Taken
* **Data Migration:** Identified ~20GB of legacy Windows data for archival.
* **Compression:** Wrapped data into a `.7z` archive using Ultra settings.
    * *Error Handling:* Encountered `Access Denied` on `ccsetup.exe`. Verified archive integrity; structure is sound.
    * *Final Size:* 17.3 GB.
* **Redundancy (3-2-1 Backup):**
    * **Local 1:** Copied to 128GB Ventoy Drive (exFAT).
    * **Local 2:** Created dedicated Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS Bootable (16GB Rufus).
    * **Cloud:** Uploading to Student Google Drive as an off-site fail-safe.
* **Branding:** Established **KohoJiro** GitHub identity and initialized this log.

### ⚠️ Technical Notes
* **Metadata Warning:** Confirmed that "Loss of Properties" during copy to exFAT does not affect `.7z` or `.iso` integrity.
* **Redundancy:** Utilizing both a "Swiss Army Knife" Ventoy drive and a dedicated Rufus drive for hardware flexibility.

### 📍 Next Steps
1. Perform SHA256 Hash verification once files are settled.
2. Wipe HP Laptop hardware and initiate Ubuntu Server installation.
3. Establish SSH handshake between Karasu (Server) and T14 (Workstation).

## Log: 2026-01-09 - Strategy Finalization & Integrity Audit
**Date:** 2026-01-09  
**Status:** ✅ Phase 1 (Post Migration Audit &  Documentation) - COMPLETE

---

### 🛠 Actions Taken
* **Infrastructure Scoping:** Formally defined the "Headless Pivot" strategy. Documented the transition of the HP 17z-ca300 from a primary workstation to Node 01 (Karasu) to bypass known internal hardware failures.
* **Documentation Architecture:** * Created and initialized the Project README.
    * Established a "Strategy Rationale" section to justify the repurposing of failing hardware.
    * Defined Node 02 requirements (Lenovo T14 Gen 6) to resolve the current procurement blocker.
* **Integrity Validation (Manual Hash Audit):** Performed a three-step verification to ensure 100% data integrity before disk decommissioning:
    1. **Local Hash Generation:** Generated SHA256 for the source archive
       * *Command:* '(Get-FileHash C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Transfer_to_T14.7z -Algorithm SHA256)'
    2. **Remote Hash Generation:** Generated SHA256 for the Ventoy destination archive.
       * *Command:* '(Get-FileHash E:\Transfer_to_T14.7z -Algorithm SHA256)'
    3. **Comparative Validation:** Verified strings via PowerShell logic:
       * *Command:* `(Get-Content "$HOME\Desktop\Original_Hash.txt").Trim() -eq (Get-Content "$HOME\Desktop\Ventoy_Hash.txt").Trim()`
       * *Result:* `True` (Bit-perfect integrity confirmed).

### 🛡️ Verified Data Signature
* **Archive:** `Transfer_to_T14.7z` (17.3 GB)
* **SHA256:** `A5B92844D629B230CB1EFBBAC027CCF0B9C325E25AEC47A95D0C076DAFCACCBB`

### 📍 Project State: STAGED
The project is officially paused pending hardware procurement. Data is verified, redundant, and archived. The technical roadmap is locked.
