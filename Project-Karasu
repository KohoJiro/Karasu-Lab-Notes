# 🐦 Project Karasu: Lab Notes
## Day 0: Migration & Infrastructure Prep

**Date:** 2026-01-08  
**Status:** ✅ Phase 1 Complete

---

### 🛠 Actions Taken
* **Data Migration:** Identified ~20GB of legacy Windows data for archival.
* **Compression:** Wrapped data into a `.7z` archive using Ultra settings.
    * *Error Handling:* Encountered `Access Denied` on `ccsetup.exe`. Verified archive integrity; structure is sound.
    * *Final Size:* 17.3 GB.
* **Redundancy (3-2-1 Backup):**
    * **Local 1:** Copied to 128GB Ventoy Drive (exFAT).
    * **Local 2:** Created dedicated Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS Bootable (16GB Rufus).
    * **Cloud:** Uploading to Student Google Drive as an off-site fail-safe.
* **Branding:** Established **KohoJiro** GitHub identity and initialized this log.

### ⚠️ Technical Notes
* **Metadata Warning:** Confirmed that "Loss of Properties" during copy to exFAT does not affect `.7z` or `.iso` integrity.
* **Redundancy:** Utilizing both a "Swiss Army Knife" Ventoy drive and a dedicated Rufus drive for hardware flexibility.

### 📍 Next Steps
1. Perform SHA256 Hash verification once files are settled.
2. Wipe HP Laptop hardware and initiate Ubuntu Server installation.
3. Establish SSH handshake between Karasu (Server) and T14 (Workstation).
